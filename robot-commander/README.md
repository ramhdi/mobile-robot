`robot-commander` is a companion software for mobile robot that commands the robot based on high-level inputs such as computer vision.

## Environment setup
This software requires **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**. Python scripts are run using default `python3` provided by Ubuntu 22.04.
```bash
$ python3 --version
Python 3.10.12
```
It is **discouraged** to use virtual environments for python development as ROS libraries are not installable through virtual environment. All dependencies need to be installed globally.
